# RFC policy - the Fairdrive protocol

Changes to the Fairdrive protocol will be managed by the Fairdrive protocol sub-team. The general process for RFCs applies, although a diagram with more details of the process is provided to facilitate work and available as [process diagram](./resources/process-diagram.md).

RFCs done at the Fairdrive protocol level are also referred to as Fairdrive improvement proposals or FIPs.
