# Summary

This is a special, genesis FIP, defining the rules and process for all the following FIPs.



# Fairdrive improvement proposals

Some non-substantial changes to Fairdrive protocol can be managed through a GitHub pull request workflow.

Substantial changes must be put through a design process and build a consensus among the Fair Data Society community and sub-teams handling a particular area.

The Fairdrive improvement proposal (FIP) process is intended to provide a path for new specifications and features to be added to the Fairdrive protocol (FDP). This should increase confidence of all the stakeholders of the direction the Fairdrive protocol evolution.



## When to follow the FIP process

The FIP process must be followed with:

- new specifications as part of Fairdrive protocol,
- substantial changes to existing specifications.

Example of substantial change might be:

- adding features or changing interfaces for the Fairdrive protocol.



## Before creating a FIP

Low quality proposals or those for features already rejected or that do not fit into the roadmap, will be rejected. Therefore, before submitting a FIP, pursue feedback from community and stakeholders in general. To go through the process smoothly, work will have to be done towards building a consensus. 

The idea for the FIP could be talked over on the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.gg/KrVTmahcUA), discussing the topic on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fds-rfcs/discussions), or even posting "pre-FIPs" on one of the channels.

As a rule of thumb, receiving encouraging feedback from long-standing project developers, and particularly members of the relevant sub-team is a good indication that the FIP is worth pursuing.
