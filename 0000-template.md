# Summary
One paragraph explanation of the proposal.

# Context and motivation
Explain the context and background for the propsal, motivation for the proposal and what it addresses with some use cases and the expected outcome.

# Guide-level explanation




Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the language and you were teaching it to another FDS programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how FDS programmers should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use FDS tooling. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing FDS programmers and new FDS programmers.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for Fairdrive protocol), this section should focus on how Fairdrive protocol contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For language, library, cargo, tools, and compiler proposals: Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other projects, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other projects is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.


# Unresolved questions
Address what:

- parts of design need to be resolved as part of the FIP process,
- parts of design need to be resolved through implementation process,
- parts are out of scope of the FIP to be resolved.

# Future possibilities
Explain how you see the proposal could change in the future. You can list things that might be out of scope of the proposal but you see might be needed in the future or are just in the idea phase at the moment.

This section could also be left blank.
