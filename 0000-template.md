# Summary
One paragraph explanation of the proposal.

# Context, motivation and guide level explanation
Explain the context and background for the proposal, motivation for the proposal and what it addresses with some use cases and the expected outcome.

Explain the proposal as if it was already implemented, including:

- explain terms and concepts,
- explain features/ideas with examples,
- explain what kind of impact the proposal will have on other areas (e.g. other proposals)

# Reference-level explanation
Technical explanation that explains the design in sufficient detail that interaction with other systems is clear and it is reasonably clear how it would get implemented. Corner case should be covered with examples.

------

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Fair Data Principles alignment
Is the proposal aligned with the [Fair Data Society principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org/)? Why is it good for the Fair Data Society? What kind of final use cases can emerge from the proposal?

# Prior art
Discuss what prior art exists in relation to the FIP. This shows the author has studied the field and also informs the readers of the state of affairs.

# Unresolved questions
Address what:

- parts of design need to be resolved as part of the FIP process,
- parts of design need to be resolved through implementation process,
- parts are out of scope of the FIP to be resolved,
- any possible drawbacks of the design.
